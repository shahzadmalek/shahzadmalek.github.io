          What have I learned from this experience?  
        </h4>
      </h2>
	  
       <ul>
									<li>Teamwork: From working in Laasani Restuarant I learned how to work and efficiently communicate with different individuals in a team who comes from different culture, beliefs, background & values, and how my decision can impact the team I work with and also the company at large. </li>
									<li>Communication and interpersonal skills: Another important thing I learned was, how to communicate with fellow employees or team members and to hear their perspective or point of view regarding a situation that can help to make a good decision, which can benefit both the team and company.</li>
									<li>Managerial & Problem-solving skills: Thirdly, As working as an Assistant Manager, I learned how to solve problems a company faces on a day to day bases such as conflicts between employees relating to work, the employee not doing his/her work properly or any other problem that slows down the companies operational processes, and how I as an employee can solve this problem quickly without affecting work of other employees or the company in any negative way. And ensure that everyone is doing their work correctly and on time.</li> 
									<li>Time Management and Inventory management: The Fourth thing I learned as working in Laasani restaurant is how to manage time and inventory. Throughout my working period in Laasani, this was by far the most difficult task I have done, As an Assistant Manager, one of my Roles & Responsibility was to ensure that every part of the work was being done in the right time and every employee was doing his/her part correctly and on time. For example, during the morning which is the time for breakfast, It was my job to ensure everyone including myself to work and get the required equipment ready for the customers who came in to have breakfast, e.g. get kettle ready for warm water to make tea and coffee. And secondly Inventory management, as an Assistant Manager it was my duty to ensure that inventory is up to date and no stock is finished, so when customers come he/she gets what they came for, and order new merchandise on time from suppliers before the stock is finished. For example, as earlier, during breakfast, the restaurant must have enough resources such as tea, coffee, glasses, etc. available for that period.</li>

        </h4>
      </h2>
	  
       <ul>
									<li>Communication skills: Working as a Peer Mentor enabled me to boost my ability to communicate interactively with a larger group of first-year students who are new to the university environment and try to understand their point of view and how I can play a role to help them find direction by mentoring and guiding them towards the right direction and enjoy their stay in university.</li>
									<li>Team player and problem-solving: Work effectively with other mentors to help guide and educate first-year students about the peer-mentor programme, how the university environment is & what is expected from them( first-year students), and also try to understand the students' problem as a team and try to find an effective solution that can help solve the students' problems. </li>
									<li>Motivator and Role model: As working as a Peer Mentor I learned that I was not working to help students with academic studies only, but also play three important roles in their first academic year, Firstly act as a motivator, who encourages and boosts student morale to achieve greater goals. Secondly as a good listener who listens to these first-year students, not as a mentor or senior but as a friend with whom they can comfortably communicate with regarding a problem they encounter. And lastly, as an effective leader who tries to understand the problem and helps find solutions to solve problems and help get some direction to move forward.</li>

       <ul>
									<li>Communication Skills: Working as Winter Camp Facilitator helped me to communicate effectively with individuals in a large crowd of matric students coming from different schools. </li>
									<li>Disturbance Handler: Another thing I learned as working as Winter Camp Facilitator is that it is important to handle hard situations or problem that brings roadblock with calmness and dedication. For example, if the lecturers or students are lost about where their class are, it is important to take charge and guide them to the right class, or when the lecturer needs resources like marker pens, or whiteboards in classrooms to continue teaching, it is our role to handle such disturbance and make sure everything runs smoothly.</li>
									<li>Managerial skills: Thirdly, I learned that it is important to monitor students to ensure they are attending classes and not roaming or bunking class or whether they attending the right class. And also monitor beforehand to whether the classrooms have all the resources that the lecturer needs to conduct their lessons, and to ensure whether the lecturers are in classrooms teaching the learners during the period allocated to them.</li> 
									<li>Resource Allocation: Lastly I learned while working as Winter Camp Facilitator is that it is our responsibility to allocate required resources to lecturers and students. For example, it is the Facilitator responsibility to ask the lecturer what resources will they need during their class time, for example,  marker pens, a whiteboard, to teach and how many marker pens does he need and what colour of markers do they need for instance blue, black and red before the lecturers go for class. And also monitor the lecturers so that they take the required amount of stationary and not more, and also ensure that lecturers don't finish all the stationery given to them quickly </li>
