									<h2>About me</h2>
									
								</header>
								<hr />
								<p> I am a bright and hardworking individual who completed a very comprehensive degree in BCom Information Systems during the period of 2019, from North-West University and currently doing postgraduate (Honours)in BCom Information Systems. I am a proactive problem solver with strong organisational and communication skills, who wishes to employ all such knowledge and skills that I have acquired throughout my studies and experiences, with the intention of securing a professional career with opportunities for challenges and advancement through a commercially focused and forward-thinking company. I take pride in the person I am, which is a trustworthy, well mannered, disciplined and goal orientated and hardworking individual. Always striving to perform tasks assigned to me in the best possible manner with a mindset of completing the assigned task in the right time that yields best possible results.
Among other things, I enjoy accumulating knowledge in my spare time, not limiting it to a specific subject, scope or topic and also try to improve my programming skills in C#, Java, web development and by applying theory into practical work. I am an individaul that gets highly motivated when faced with new challenges and always on a lookout for ways to solve real world problems by using the knowledge I have acquired to benefit the society and help impact lives of others and myself, in a positive way that helps growth and distribution of knowledge.   </p>
								<p>Currently, I am enhancing my skills and knowledge in subjects such as Blockchain, Networking, Artificial intelligence and Cyber-security and white and grey hat hacking which are important aspects, that can play an important aspect to achieve 4th industrial revolution yet to come. My hobbies are reading books, tennis, cooking, photo editing, web designing and learning how to carpenter. My hobbies have instilled me in vital life skills, which have aided me to prosper and grow as an individual. I believe that these skills and experiences may be utilised to their fullest benefit on a more professional level at the firm. My short-term goal is to complete my honours and spend time acquiring some knowledge in networking and cyber-security and sharpen my skills in Kali Linux by doing white hat tutorial. Whereas my long-term goal is to find a permanent career as an IT Audit or Network Engineer. </p>

										<h2>Goals</h2>
										<p></p>
									</header>
									<hr />
									<p>My long term goal is to be an IT Auditor or a Network Engineer, I try my utmost best in order to learn and gain knowledge & experience in the fields of Security and Network to be able to achieve my goals and secure a position as an IT Auditor or a Network Engineer. I continuously enhance my knowledge and skills by watching tutorials and aim to get certain certifications (will be discussed in the Certifications section) that can help me gain more knowledge to achieve my long term goals. I also aspire to motivate others around me in a positive manner using my communication and interpersonal skills I acquired from experience in order to better my life and the society at large as you can read from the JunctionX page, where we try to teach and motivate students to learn skillsets about web development, E-commerce website creation, etc. so that these skillsets can help them make a living in future.</p>
								<p>My current short-term goals for 2020 are:
								<ul>
								<li>To complete my honours in BCom Information Systems.</li>
								<li>Read and Watch tutorials on Networking and CCNA, to gain more knowledge on Networking & its devices, and how network architecture is created & how these devices connect and communicate with each other in a network.</li>
								<li>Watch tutorials on web-development using DJango Framework to improve my web-development skills further and develop practical websites which can be viewed in GitHub(soon!!!).</li>
								<li>Watch tutorial on Cyber-security and Kali Linux, in order to learn more about Security vulnerabilities & Ethical Hacking, and prepare for CEH certification.</li>
								</ul>

										<h2>Certifications</h2>
										<p></p>
									</header>
									<hr />
									<p>In order to achieve my long term goals and pursue a career as an IT Auditor or Network Engineer, I wish to do certain certifications that can help me or make it easier for me to reach my goal.
									<p>Certifications I want to do to gain knowledge on Security and Networking, are:<ul>
									<ul> Security certifications:
									
							        <li>Certified Ethical Hacker(CEH) Certification</li>
									<li>Certified Information Security Manager(CISM) certification</li>
									<li>CompTIA Security PLus certification</li>
									<li>Certified Information Security Auditor(CISA) certification: In order to be an official Certified IT Auditor </li>
									</ul>
									<ul> Network certifications:
									
							        <li>A+ & N+ Certification</li>
									<li>CCNA certification</li>
									<li>CompTIA Network Plus certification</li>
									<li>Certified Information Security Auditor(CISA) certification: In order to be an official Certified IT Auditor </li>
									</ul>
									
									Or any other certification that can help me get closer to achieving my goal as to become an IT Auditor or Network Engineer. However, I do not currently have any financial means to be able to pay for these certifications due to their high cost, hence I hope to get a steady financial income that can help me to be able to do these certifications and reach my long-term goals. I will keep working hard in order to achieve my goals and secure a professional career in the fields of security and network.
